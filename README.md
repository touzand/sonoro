## initial concept

If you're anything like me, whether studying or programming, you always like background noise. Sometimes we just want to listen to the rain, the sound of distant birds singing, the fire of a bonfire, or some lofi hip hop. and occasionally we want to hear particular noises, so we search for a video on YouTube about it; occasionally we find it, occasionally we don't.

Herein lies Sonoro's contribution. You may open Sonoro, put on your headphones, and then immediately begin "configuring" your sound environment whatever you wish. as you please You may create as many mixes as you like, and once you find a really good one, you can store it as a profile so that, when you return to Sonoro later, you can listen to the same mix if you like.

>for example you can save profiles as 'study' or 'work' or 'sleep' or whatever you want.

You may play with more than 20 different sounds in Sonoro. from wind, rain, and thunder to a zombie apocalypse, a medieval conflict, or a nuclear alert... I know. I'll admit that while looking for sounds, I came across some unusual and fascinating ones that I wanted to include.

## Features
1. Master volume control
2. Many relaxing sounds and others ... stressful
3. Nice and simple interface

# Development process

### Figma / keyframes

When this idea occurred, the design of the page came to mind almost immediately. so, as soon as possible, i went to figma and started to solidify the initial concept of Sonoro :

after having more or less the initial money finished. and already having an idea of its structure and how it would work, I began to program it.

### Node / Express

So I started programming the back-end with Node.js `Express.js` while I was searching the internet for sounds to get an idea of which would be good to have on Sonoro and which would not. to give me an idea.

This process of searching for sounds and programming the part of the Sonoro server lasted at least 3 or 4 days. on the fifth day I already had about 15 sounds prepared and the server working

### React

With this ready, I started programming the backend part with React using various additional tools like `React-icons` or `Styled-components` among other things. I use these tools almost in my day to day since they speed up my work a lot when working on the front-end

And this process did not last long thanks to the fact that I already had an idea embodied. I mean the keyframes that I had done in figma days ago. having that visual support of a piece of money, however simple it may be, helps you a lot since you don't waste time thinking about the design when programming the page or its operation.
